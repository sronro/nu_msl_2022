# Patent Landscape Analysis Using NLP

This repository contains modules for in-class exercises that I use in teaching Patent Landscape Analysis Using NLP at Northwestern Law. 

For this class, I use a Natural Language Processing method called non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on patents, to find trends in self-driving car technology. NMF is based on multivariate analysis and linear algebra and is often used to find topic clusters in a large body of text.

This method can be useful for patent practitioners. In strategic business decision-making, looking at patents can be informative because companies often shape their strategies around patents.

Using computer programming, I can get to the essence of over 1000 patents within just minutes. Also, I can visualize my results without having to read and manually analyze texts.

Self-driving cars require several different technologies to work. They need special mechanical components, sensors, and innovative ways to process data, among others. We want to determine what are such technologies using NMF. By plotting changes in patent filing volume for each of these technologies, we will try to make observations as to where things are headed in the field of self-driving cars.
